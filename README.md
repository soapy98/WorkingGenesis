Project completed in the second semester worth 50% of a single module, Advanced Rendering and Virtual Environments.

Using the basic UWP framework for DirectX 11 I had to create an Alien Planet with effects primarily made completely with HLSL and HLSL targeting graphics hardware supporting shader model 5 profile. The objective was to implement a variety of techniques explicitly and implicitly using tessellation shaders and ray marching/ray tracing to achieve different graphical effects in HLSL to provide a visually appealing graphical scene.

Each graphics object had to be properly modelled, illuminated, and realistically animated for dynamic objects alongside all the objects needing to be carefully coordinated to provide a visually appealing graphics scene.
